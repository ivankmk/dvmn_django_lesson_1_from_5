- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Go to the folder `cd where-to-go` 
- Create the file `.env` with variables ```DEBUG```,  ```STATIC_DIR``` and ```SECRET_KEY```
- Initiate DB`python3 manage.py migrate`
- Run the server `python3 manage.py runserver`

To quickly fill the database, use the load_place management command, the argument for which is a list of links to json files with location data:

```python3 manage.py load_place http://website/file.json```
